# Hand-Brightness-Controller
The Hand Brightness Controller project uses computer vision algorithms to detect hand gestures and adjust the brightness of a display or image accordingly. By using a webcam, the system tracks the position and movement of a userâ€™s hand, recognizing specific gestures that correspond to increasing or decreasing brightness.
